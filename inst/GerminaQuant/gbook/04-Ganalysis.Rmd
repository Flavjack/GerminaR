# Germination analysis

After the data collection, the information can be processed using GerminaQuant App. The web application can be used in any device, connected to the internet, in an interactive way. The application is compound in tabs (Table \@ref(tab:tabs)) that allow to make the analysis very easy.


```{r tabs, echo=FALSE}
tab <- data.frame( 
"Tabs" = c("Introduction", "Data Import", "Germination Analysis", "Statisdtical Analysis", "Multi Plot", "Germination in Time"), 
"Description" = c('Presentation of GerminaQuant and description of the germination variables', "Allow to upload the fieldbook, visualize all the data and chose the parameter for the analysis .", "Calculate automatically the germination variables and export the data file.", "Allow to chose the variables according the experimental design for analysis of variance and summarise the information", "Plot the mean comparison test for the variables selected in diffrente plots: bar, line and boxplot.", "Selecting the treatment, allows plotting the germination process.")
)

knitr::kable(
  tab, 
  booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = 'Name and description of each tab of GerminaQuant to evaluate and analyze the germination process'
  )
```
